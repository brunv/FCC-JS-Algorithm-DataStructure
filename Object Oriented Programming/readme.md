## Object Oriented Programming
At its core, software development solves a problem or achieves a results with computation. The software development process first defines a problem, then presents a solution. Object oriented programming is one of several major approaches to the software process.

As its name implies, object oriented programming organizes code into object definition. These are sometimes called classes, and they group togheter data with related behavior. The data is an object's attributes, and the behavior (or functions) are methods.

The object structure makes it flexible within a program. Objects can transfer information by calling and passing data to another object's methods. Also, new classes can receive, or inherit, all the features from a base or parent class. This helps to reduce repeated code.

Your choice of programming approach depends on a few factors. These include the type of problem, as well as how you want to structure your data and algorithms.
