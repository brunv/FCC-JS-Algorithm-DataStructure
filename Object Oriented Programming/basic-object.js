/**
 *  Create a Basic Object:
 * 
 *  Think about things people see everyday, like cars, shops, and birds. These are
 *  all objects: tangible things people can observe and interact with.
 *  The qualities, or properties, define what makes up an object. Note that similar
 *  objects share the same properties, but many have different values for those
 *  properties.
 *  Objects in JavaScript are used to model real-world objects, giving them
 *  properties and behavior just like their real-world counterparts.

// Here's an example using these concepts to create a duck object:

let duck = {
    name: "Aflac",
    numLegs: 2
};
