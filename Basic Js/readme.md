## Basic of JavaScript

### Variables
JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object.

When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters. Best Practice: Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase.

### Strings
In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\\) in front of the quote.

Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript. The reason why you might want to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in a string. 

In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
